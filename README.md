Project 6

I designed this project starting with the biggest intial challenge which was getting a responsive splash screen first. After several different design versions of that i started playing around with js and css elements. i implemented a CS record that animates on load using jquery. After this i prioritized cleaning up the CSS and adding a theme switcher utilizing JS. Finally i implemented media querys and a set of semi responsive flex boxes.
